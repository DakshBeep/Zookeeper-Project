This is my first coding project in Python. Through this project, I learned how to:
- Use basic input and output functions.
- Work with loops and conditional statements.
- Manipulate strings and lists.
- Implement basic error handling.

The biggest challenge I faced was converting a number string into an integer. I learned how to extract digits from a string and use the `int()` function to perform the conversion.
